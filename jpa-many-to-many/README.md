## Java Spring Boot - JPA - Hibernate - H2 - Many To Many Bidirectional Relationship - @ManyToMany
Implementation of many to many bidirectional relationship using Java, Spring Boot, JPA, Hibernate and H2 in memory database. We will start with generating project and adding all of the necessary dependencies. Later on we will create entities and then we will create a many to many relationship between them using @ManyToMany and @JoinColumns annotations. We will persist example data in database using CRUD repositories to test out if our mapping works correctly. We will track everything using H2 console.
